    MuJoCo's `fovy` is the full vertical field of view in degrees; pixels
    are square (the renderer doesn't introduce anisotropic scaling), so
    fx == fy follows directly from fy and the image height. The principal
    point is assumed at the image center - true for an ideal pinhole render
    with no cropping/offset, which is what mujoco.Renderer produces.

    dist_coeffs is all zeros: the renderer has no lens distortion model, so
    the detected marker corners are already distortion-free.
