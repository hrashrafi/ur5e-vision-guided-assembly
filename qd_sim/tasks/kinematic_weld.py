"""
Kinematic weld: rigidly attaches a mocap body to a site (normally the
gripper's pinch site) once engaged, so it follows the site exactly every
tick - a real weld, not a simulated hold. Replaces relying on contact
friction/mass/inertia to keep a grasped part in the gripper (see world.xml's
QD body comment for why: that was a genuinely unstable grip at several
grasp heights, however much force or ramp-timing was thrown at it).

The weld itself is nothing more than "remember the target's pose in the
site's local frame, then rebuild the target's world pose from that local
pose every time the site moves" - the same parent/child pose composition
used throughout qd_sim.utils.transforms, just applied every tick instead of
once.
